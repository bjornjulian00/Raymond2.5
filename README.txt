Features:
- The amazing black screen
	Feast your eyes on the computational marvel brought forth by this program: a completely black screen!

Actual features:
- Phong shading
- Scene graph heirarchy
- User movable camera
- Placeable light sources

Lower level info:
- Data structure for scenegraph <list>
- Specular lighting
- Diffuse lighting
- Model view matrix in Mesh.cs
- Uniform var in fs for ambient light
- Single hardcoded light for testing purposes


Explanation:

To be honest, we are both less than proud of this program.
We misinterpreted the due date as June 25 (as stated on the cs.uu.nl site) instead of the teams site, leaving us with an incomplete program.
We decided to take the 1 day late penalty, and tried to implement the final part: the scene graph.
However, after implementing it, things went very south; no matter what, our implementation of the scenegraph would not work whatsoever.
If you are reading this, please let me know what went wrong, I have been staring for hours at the same 3 lines and I want nothing more than to know what is causing it.

Alas, all our program produces now is a black screen.
You could really enjoy the cool shading that I programmed, if it worked properly...

I understand that the project warrants a 1 as it is now, but I poured a lot of time into this.
I bothered my friends with questions until they couldn't help me anymore, I watched the same 3 colleges like I watch Spongebob the first season (often :)).
I know that I won't get a passing grade, and this project deserves whatever grade it gets, but please at least appreciate the work I put into the code.
That is all, thank you for reading this.
